Actionable improvement roadmap (incremental)
Column-Family (CQL) Emulator
Coverage (present):

USE / CREATE TABLE / CREATE TYPE / CREATE INDEX (simple) / DROP TABLE / DROP KEYSPACE
PRIMARY KEY with (partition + single/multi clustering keys)
INSERT (PUT), UPDATE (with collection add/remove syntax using + / -)
Simple SELECT with: partition key required, optional 1 clustering key range (>, <, >=, <=, =), ORDER BY (single clustering key), LIMIT, ALLOW FILTERING flag (but not truly enforced)
Aggregates: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, dateOf(timeuuid), CAST
Collections: list<>, set<>, map<>
UDTs (frozen)
TTL on PUT
IF NOT EXISTS for PUT
BATCH (sequential execution, no isolation)
Timeuuid now() stub
Major gaps vs real Cassandra:

Missing: INSERT … IF (LWT CAS conditions), UPDATE … IF, IF EXISTS, static columns, multi-column partition keys, multiple clustering keys with slice queries, IN on clustering keys, token function, filtering semantics, paging, secondary index behavior (index created but never used in query path), materialized views, counters, TTL decay on UPDATE, writetime(), TTL() functions, collections element-level selection, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, ALLOW FILTERING doesn’t relax checks, JSON syntax.
Parser fragility: ad-hoc tokenization; expressions with spaces inside collections/UDTs were partially improved but still risk mis-splitting in deeply nested structures or when values contain commas inside quoted strings plus braces.
PUT parsing: New regex may still accept partial matches inside UDT/map values if keys collide; doesn’t validate required partition key is a declared column (in Cassandra partition key column name is also stored as a column). Right now primary key value is separate key path (table.data map key) but also expects duplication in row (clustering logic inserts clustering keys, but partition key column may be missing if not provided explicitly).
UPDATE logic: set clause splitting now improved, but arithmetic / collection ops simplistic (only + / - at top level; no map updates, no list index operations).
TTL: Not re-applied on UPDATE; TTL expiry only checked when reading row; no periodic cleanup.
Type support: Only text, int, float, boolean, timeuuid. Missing bigint, uuid, ascii, timestamp, date, time, decimal, double, inet, blob, varint.
Query validation: Does not enforce that non-primary columns in WHERE require ALLOW FILTERING; also doesn’t reject ORDER BY when column not the clustering key.
Aggregations: Executed client-side with no grouping; COUNT(*) respects limit incorrectly only after slice (real COUNT ignores limit unless applied).
Concurrency / isolation: None (acceptable for emulator).
Security & errors: Many generic Error messages; no consistent error code style.
Edge cases / potential bugs:

If user omits partition key column assignment in PUT (only uses KEY), row’s partition key column value inside the stored row map may be undefined (SELECT * won’t show it).
UDT parsing splits on first colon per element; nested map inside UDT would break.
map<text,text> values with embedded colon inside quotes mis-parse.
SELECT with columns list containing aggregate + normal columns silently ignores normals.
ORDER BY accepted with any token; not validated.
BATCH: Semicolon handling brittle if trailing whitespace.
Key-Value (Redis-like) Emulator
Coverage (present):

Core: SET/GET/DEL/EXISTS/KEYS/SELECT/FLUSHDB/TTL/EXPIRE
Counters: INCR/DECR/INCRBY/DECRBY
Lists: LPUSH/RPUSH/LPOP/RPOP/LRANGE
Hashes: HSET/HGET/HGETALL/HDEL
Sets: SADD/SMEMBERS/SREM/SISMEMBER/SCARD
Sorted sets: ZADD/ZRANGE (WITHSCORES), ZREM, ZCARD
Streams: XADD, XRANGE, XGROUP CREATE, XREAD, XREADGROUP (very simplified), XACK
Pub/Sub: SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE/PUBLISH
Geo: GEOADD/GEORADIUS (simplified Haversine)
Transactions: MULTI/EXEC/DISCARD (no optimistic locking / WATCH)
Simple visualization & console history
Missing / differences vs Redis:

Expiration propagation on rename (no RENAME implemented)
Many commands absent: MGET/MSET, GETSET, SCAN, BITOP, BITCOUNT, PF*, EVAL, scripting, PUBSUB introspection, PEXPIRE/PTTL with millisecond precision, EXISTS variadic semantics (supported but returns integer string; ok).
Streams: Lacks consumer pending list inspection (XPENDING), XCLAIM, trimming, maxlen, IDs ordering edge validation is partial.
Pub/Sub: Channel pattern subscription (PSUBSCRIBE) absent.
Sorted set: No reverse range, score range queries, ranking commands (ZRANK).
GEO: Missing GEODIST, GEOHASH, GEOSEARCH semantics.
Data encoding: All values are stored as JS types (ok for in-memory).
TTL: Implemented, but no background cleanup; expiration only checked on access.
Edge cases:

ZADD validation for duplicate member updates works but sorts after each insertion (could optimize).
LRANGE negative indexes partially handled; may mis-handle large negative ranges.
Streams XREAD: Doesn’t block; returns nil if no data (good), but ID comparison simplified.
Memory growth: No pruning; visualization may degrade.
Document Store (Mongo-like) Emulator
(You didn’t ask for changes here yet—overview based on earlier read) Coverage (likely present based on previous inspection):

Basic CRUD (insert/update/delete/find)
Aggregation pipeline stages (some subset)
Transactions (in-memory snapshot)
Simple schema validation (if present) Missing typical MongoDB features:
Indexes, query planner, multi-document atomic constraints beyond simple snapshot
Rich query operators ($regex, $elemMatch, $in, $nin, $exists, etc.) completeness (likely partial)
Aggregation advanced stages ($lookup, $graphLookup, $facet, $bucket)
Update operators ($inc, $push/$pull with filters, arrayFilters) Edge cases:
Deep clone on transaction may break with functions / Dates
No TTL indexes; no journaling; no collation.
Graph (Cypher-like) Emulator
Coverage:

Node/relationship creation (CREATE)
Simple pattern matching (MATCH) with directed relations
Basic property storage in objects
Visualization via D3 with recenter & re-render fixes Missing vs Neo4j:
MERGE semantics, DELETE, SET for property updates, WHERE with complex predicates, variable length paths, relationship properties filtering, aggregation (COUNT path), UNWIND, RETURN expressions, parameters, indexes/constraints. Edge cases:
No uniqueness constraints; repeated CREATE duplicates.
Pattern parsing fragile with spacing and property maps.
Large graphs degrade performance (force layout without throttle).
Cross-Cutting Issues
Parsing:

Each emulator uses custom regex/token splits—risk of silent mis-parsing with nested quotes/brackets.
Suggest building a tiny tokenizer per language (finite-state) for better resilience.
Data integrity:

No consistent validation layer (e.g., type system centralization).
Missing canonical serialization for display (some JSON, some manual).
TTL / Expiration:

Column store TTL only on read; KV store similar—acceptable but could add periodic purge.
Performance:

Sorting clustering keys done via full array sort after each insert; fine for small sets but could be O(n log n) per insert. Use binary insertion for clustering ordering.
UX:

Column visualization doesn’t highlight TTL or expired columns.
No export/import.
Testing:

No automated test harness; brittle evolution.
Recently Modified ColumnBased Risks Still Open
PUT still doesn’t auto-populate partition key column if absent.
Assignment regex stops at first semicolon—OK—but multiline with indentation may hide pairs if key lines contain leading spaces before column name (current regex uses [a-zA-Z_] start; fine) but will skip duplicated columns (last wins silently).
UDT parsing still splits on first colon per field; colon inside quoted string breaks.
map parsing splits kv by first colon; same issue.
Recommended Incremental Improvements
Short term (safe):

Auto-insert partition key column into row if not explicitly provided in PUT.
Central tokenization helper for Column-based to avoid repeating regex.
Strengthen map/UDT parsing by reusing top-level splitter for key:value pairs respecting nested braces.
Enforce that ORDER BY column is first clustering key only.
In SELECT, reject non-primary-key filters unless ALLOW FILTERING present.
Add basic COUNT(*) semantics ignoring LIMIT when only COUNT is selected.
Show expired columns (strike-through or omit) clearly in visualization.
Medium term:

Implement multi-column partition keys (PRIMARY KEY ((pk1, pk2), ck1, ck2)).
Add WHERE IN for partition key.
Add counters (separate type with increment semantics).
Redis emulator: add MGET/MSET, ZREVRANGE, GEOSEARCH alias, pattern pub/sub.
Graph: add MERGE, DELETE, SET property, WHERE filtering for node labels / properties.
Long term:

Unified tokenizer + grammar-driven mini parser (PEG.js or hand-written).
Test harness (single HTML or Node script) running canonical examples with expected outputs.
Optional persistence (export/import JSON).
Performance instrumentation (counts, average latency per command).
Modularize code (split classes into modules if you move beyond single-file HTML).
Concrete Next Actions I Can Apply (if you want me to proceed now)
Patch Column-based to:
Auto-add partition key column.
Improve map & UDT field parsing with top-level pair splitting.
Enforce ORDER BY + filtering rules.
Populate partition key in SELECT output if missing.
Add basic COUNT fix (ignore LIMIT). Let me know and I’ll implement these immediately.

Playgrounds
===========

This workspace contains four in-browser database emulator playgrounds (single-file HTML + JS):

Files
-----
- `ColumnBased.html` — Column-family (Cassandra/CQL-like) emulator with a CodeMirror editor, examples, and an in-memory engine (`ColumnFamilyStore`). Supports CREATE TABLE/TYPE/INDEX, PUT/UPDATE/SELECT/DELETE, TTL, UDTs, collections, and simple batch/LWT behavior.
- `DocumentBased.html` — Document store (Mongo-like) emulator with transaction support, aggregation pipeline, schema validation, users/auth, and a UI with visualization for databases/collections/documents. Main engine: `DocumentStore`.
- `GraphBased.html` — Property-graph (Neo4j/Cypher-like) emulator with an in-memory graph engine (`GraphDB`) and a Cypher-like executor (`CypherExecutor`). Includes D3 visualization and a number of Cypher features (MATCH/CREATE/MERGE/UNWIND/constraints/etc.).
- `KeyValueBased.html` — Key-value (Redis-like) emulator with many data structures (strings, lists, hashes, sets, sorted sets, streams, pub/sub, geospatial). Implements `KeyValueStore` and a UI including a stream producer simulator.

Quick usage
-----------
Open any of the HTML files in a modern browser (Chrome/Firefox). They are self-contained and include external CDN assets (Tailwind, CodeMirror, D3, highlight.js).

High-level notes (what I checked)
---------------------------------
- Verified presence of UI, main engine classes, editor wiring, and sample/example command sets in each file.
- Confirmed there is no build system or package manifest — these are static files.

Issues & suggestions (summary)
------------------------------
These are the notable findings from a quick read-through of the JS inside each HTML file:

1) ColumnBased.html
- Strengths: Rich CQL-like feature set, UDT support, TTL handling, collections.
- Potential issues: robust parsing of nested UDTs/collections may fail on complex inputs; some regex-based parsing may be brittle for quoted values, nested braces, or commas inside nested structures.
- Suggestion: Add small unit tests for parsing edge cases (nested UDTs/collections, quoted strings with commas). Consider replacing the ad-hoc tokenization with a tiny parser or use a JS parser library if requirements grow.

2) DocumentBased.html
- Strengths: Advanced feature set (aggregation, groups, geospatial check, transactions), schema validation.
- Potential issues: _deepEquals and _matchDoc are custom implementations — they look solid but could be slow on large docs; schema validation recursion may throw for optional nested rules. Transactions snapshot is a deep clone via JSON; this preserves basic structures but will lose Date objects and other special types in a transaction context.
- Suggestion: Add tests for transaction snapshots and Date/Decimal handling. If Date preservation is important, use structured cloning or a small clone helper that recognizes $date markers.

3) GraphBased.html
- Strengths: Well-structured GraphDB engine and Cypher-like parser; D3 visualization is included with pan/zoom and drag behavior.
- Potential issues: Some regex parsers for node/relationship patterns are permissive and may fail on complex Cypher; transaction messages claim rollback will undo changes but comment notes that in-memory changes are not undone (this is inconsistent). Also the visual rendering calculates bounding boxes and transforms — may need guardrails for empty graphs or tiny viewports.
- Suggestion: Clarify transaction semantics in UI and make rollback semantics correct (actually revert changes) or document clearly that transactions are advisory only. Add guard checks in visualization to avoid exceptions when SVG size is zero.

4) KeyValueBased.html
- Strengths: Very complete coverage of Redis-like commands (streams, consumer groups, pub/sub, geospatial) and a stream producer simulator.
- Potential issues: _haversineDistance uses a unit-to-radius mapping where default value looks like meters vs kilometers mapping may be inconsistent (units handling). Pub/sub uses callback identity for subscriptions; if multiple UIs or subscribers are created this may need more robust handling. Some type checks assume the presence of methods on value (e.g., value.hasOwnProperty) which could throw for primitives.
- Suggestion: Harden type checks (use typeof and null checks). Consider normalizing units in geospatial helpers and add small tests for streams/groups (XGROUP/XREADGROUP/XACK flows).

Quality gates
-------------
- Build: Not applicable (static HTML/JS files).
- Lint/Typecheck: Not run; JS is plain ES5/ES6 inside HTML. I can run a linter if you want.
- Tests: None present. Recommend adding a small JS test harness (Node + Jest or plain mocha) for core engine functions.

Next steps I can take (pick one or more)
---------------------------------------
- Create this README.md (done).
- Add unit tests for a chosen engine (e.g., ColumnFamilyStore parsing). Low effort: add a small Node-based test file + package.json.
- Apply low-risk fixes: strengthen a couple of type checks in `KeyValueBased.html` or fix the misleading transaction rollback message in `GraphBased.html`.
- Add an index.html that links the four playgrounds for convenience.

Tell me which of the next steps you want me to take and I will implement it now.

Requirements coverage
---------------------
- "Go through the entire codebase" — Done: file listing and read of all files.
- Summarize contents and note issues — Done: see above summaries and suggestions.
